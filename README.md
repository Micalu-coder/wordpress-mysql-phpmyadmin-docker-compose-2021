# wordpress-mysql-phpmyadmin-docker-compose-2021
Hey! With this docker-compose file you'll be able to build your wordpress project and mysql database. In less than 5 minutes your development environment will be ready!!

HOW TO START:

- Well, first of all you need to have installed docker and docker compose.
Here you can see step by step the installation process on linux:
  - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
  - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
 
**It's important to verify that your installed version of docker matches with the version of the docker-compose.yml file.**
See the versions here: 
  -https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/
  

Now clone this repository on your console:
  $ sudo git clone https://github.com/Micalu-coder/wordpress-mysql-phpmyadmin-docker-compose-2021.git
  
Finally add a username and password to the docker-compose.yml database part and run your container with: 
  - $ sudo docker-compose up -d

**Remember that if you have any conflict with ports you can change them in the docker-compose.yml

See you!
